The website www.toolparadise.nl is the host for a number of tools/applications. Most notably (at the moment) is 'Sketchify'.

# What is Sketchify?
With Sketchify you can convert your digital drawings to a sketch: drawings that look hand drawn. This is done using vector graphics which are stored in the SVG format. Different drawing applications/graphics editors support SVG, like Visio, Illustrator and Inkscape.

An example (original to the left and two sketchified drawings on the right):

<img src="http://www.toolparadise.nl/sample.svg" alt="Original" title="Original" width="30%">
<img src="http://www.toolparadise.nl/sample1.svg" alt="Sketchified (profile: fineliner)" title="Sketchified (profile: fineliner)" width="30%">
<img src="http://www.toolparadise.nl/sample2.svg" alt="Sketchified (profile: edding 500)" title="Sketchified (profile: edding 500)" width="30%">

# How does Sketchify work?
Sketchify changes the imported drawing by applying small random changes to positions and sizes. Straight lines become curved, figures are no longer closed and/or the filling is scratched instead of a solid color. By applying these chances the drawing seems hand drawn. You decide how much and which type of chances are applied to the drawing using a number of settings. In this way you can decide whether the result looks like a professionally drawn image or a child's drawing.

# Which settings can I use?
There are many settings. Most settings involve setting a range with a minimum and maximum value. Sketchify will use this range to select a random value from. This value is then used for the associated characteristic (for example line width). Every element will get a new random value for that specific characteristic. All elements will look different after being sketchified. The larger you make the range the more randomness will result. With most settings a smaller value will mean less impact on the result. Do you like a professional looking drawing, use relative small values and small ranges (both sliders to the left). Do you like to make clear that it is a first sketch, use bigger values and possibly larger ranges (both slides to the right).

# How can I keep my settings?
Settings can be stored in a profile. You can choose one of the three default profiles or store your own profile. The button for storing your current profile becomes active as soon as you have changed a setting. A maximum of 6 profiles can be stored. You can also replace an existing profile if you would like to. By storing your settings in a profile you can later apply these same settings to another drawing and create the same sketch effects.

# How do I keep the result?
The resulting drawing can be stored on your local computer or inside your Dropbox account.
